	<div id="content"  class="content">We have recently embarked on the most extensive marketing campaign ever undertaken by any life company specifically targeting the lack of life cover in the Irish market

Central to this campaign is a hard hitting TV advert which, together with a national and local newspaper and radio campaign, should help drive awareness and

Feedback from recent surveys: The Market is definitely out there
We recently conducted an extensive piece of customer research with the Amárach Group on peoples’ attitudes to life cover and protection products. The results were shocking and stimulating but above all extremely exciting from a business opportunity point of view. Click on the video below which will bring you to our TV Advert. We have complimented the television advertising with an extensive suite of marketing materials – flyers, DM letters, PowerPoint slide shows to run in your reception area and posters to dress your shop front window. Log on to www.bline.ie and click on the Big Ideas Day section to see if there is something there that you feel could work for you.

 Almost 1 in 2 Irish adults have NO protection cover at all – that’s 1.6million
people!

 2 out of 3 people who have cover only have enough to cover their mortgage  75,000 babies will be born in Ireland in 2011. This means a massively
increasing market for family based protection.

1 in 5 people are considering buying a life cover product in the next 12 months. What a wonderful opportunity - approximately 320,000 families waiting to be approached and already considering becoming your client!
