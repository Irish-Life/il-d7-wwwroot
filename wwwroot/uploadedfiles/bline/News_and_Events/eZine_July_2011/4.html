Irish Life was the first to bring the concept of partial payments on Specified Illness plans to the Irish market. We felt this was the right way to go forward – to pay more claims and satisfy more customers. We are now covering more illnesses on full payment and partial payment. In addition, your customers can now avail of multiple partial payments should they occur and we have significantly increased our Angioplasty offering.

Last year over €186 million was paid to the Revenue in respect of IHT. That’s at least €750 million of assets still falling into this net.

Improved product flexibility
As part of the product update we have also included product flexibility into our plans. This allows customers to make significant changes to their level or term of benefits without cancelling and taking out a new plan. Click here for more details on product news. We’ve also included a useful comparison flyer, click here to compare the various market offerings at a glance.

Click here for a Sales Idea for non-married couples

Non married couples – 1 in 10 people are co-habiting in Ireland. Are any of your clients in this group? Most people are aware that benefits passing between married couples are exempt from Inheritance & Gift Tax. However this only applies in the case of “Legal Spouses” and registered Civil Partners. All other couples are treated as strangers for capital acquisitions tax purposes.
