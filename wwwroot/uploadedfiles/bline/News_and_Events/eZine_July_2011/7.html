	<div id="content"  class="content">Irish households have in excess of €100 billion sitting in cash; the personal savings ratio is running at around 13% or €12.2 billion per annum. Of this, some may be used to pay off debts, but a large proportion is being used to increase savings. We have 2 simple solutions that we believe will help you to encourage these savers away from deposits and into more long term solutions:

Our new savings contract, Pinnacle, is designed to provide strong underlying value for the client and for the first time in this market remunerating brokers for the continuous long term advice which they provide to their clients.

For clients who have large sums of money on deposit and are worried about trying to time the markets then we have the perfect solution for you and your clients in Auto-Start. Three simple steps: 1. 2. 3. Build a portfolio that matches your clients risk Simply tick the Auto-Start box on the application form We will drip feed in 10% of the portfolio over 10 months from the safe deposit fund - currently offering ECB + 2%

Added Flexibility: You can turn Auto-Start off at any stage. Click below for our recent savings article which appeared in the Irish Broker Magazine Savings – a booming market with more yet to come Click here for a two page flyer explaining the AutoStart process in detail
