	<div id="content"  class="content">Over 500 people gathered in Croke Park to give Willie Holmes a fitting send off after 37 years in Irish Life. It was the event of the year and not to be missed as brokers, staff, colleagues, family and friends travelled from every county to ensure they were there to celebrate what was truly a most memorable evening. Kevin Murphy took the audience through Willie’s career from his very first day in 1973 as the long haired Actuarial student through to the present and his pride in winning the IBA award as General Manager, Brokerage. Tom Fitzgerald made a very gracious toast on behalf of the broker community, paying tribute to Willie’s many virtues. Words such as passion, honesty, commitment, energy, and integrity were mentioned again and again during the evening, values that he never preached but lived! Willie paid special tribute to his family for their support over the years, especially for all the birthdays, football matches and special occasions missed because of work commitments including LIMRA, Sales Institute, Actuarial Society, LIA etc. It was a huge matter of pride that his mother was there to enjoy the evening with him. What do you present a man who has everything to mark such a distinguished career? Tony Lawless managed to deliver the holy grail, the one item every Kildare man dreams of receiving in Croke Park, The Sam Maguire Cup. While Willie held Sam over his head, he put the challenge down to Dermot Early who was in the audience - that he expected Dermot to bring Sam home to Celbridge in September – it appears even in retirement Willie is still issuing orders and setting objectives!!! While we all wish Willie the very best in retirement, he has the Life Assurance Industry in his blood, and we would not be surprised to see his invaluable contribution for many more years to come!!!

Kevin Murphy, Chief Executive, makes a presentation to Willie after taking the audience rather humorously, through Willie’s Irish Life career from day one in 1973 right up to date when Irish Life took top Life Company award at the recent IBA Awards under Willie’s guidance as General Manager, Brokerage

Tony Lawless, Willie’s successor as General Manager, Brokerage managed to ‘borrow’ Sam Maguire from Cork and presented it to Willie who said that he hoped to be the 2nd Kildare man this year to lift Sam in Croke Park

Willie and his wife Breda, staunch Kildare supporters threw down the gauntlet to Kildare footballers Dermot Earley, left and Brian Flanagan right about the ‘Lillywhites’ delivering the Holy Grail to Celbridge in September!

Tom Fitzgerald made a gracious toast , on behalf of the ‘Broker Community.’ Needless to say, Willie needed a seat for this one.
