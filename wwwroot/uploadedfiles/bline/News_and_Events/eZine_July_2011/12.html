	<div id="content"  class="content">In August we will implement 2 major innovations to improve service for you and your customers.

eTexts for customers
All new customers for whom we have mobile phone numbers will have the opportunity to receive new business progress updates via text message. These updates will inform them as their application completes key stages in the New Business process:     Application received Application successfully underwritten Application needs further medical info Policy documents issued

We are also going to offer policy value texts. These will be driven by an upper and lower trigger values nominated by the customer. If the policy value breaches either value the customer is informed by text. All e-Text messages will advise the customer to contact their broker for further information. We piloted this service and customer feedback has been uniformly positive so far. The eTexting service will be voluntary – individual customers can opt out or a broker can opt on their clients behalf. As always, Irish Life puts you in control.

eDOCs for customers
Following on the success of eDocs for Brokers, from September, policy holders also will have the option of paperless policy servicing with Irish Life. In a similar fashion to eDocs for Brokers, customers will be able to opt to view all their routine correspondence on the web. Customers will receive an email and text message notification of each document produced. We are planning to run monthly incentive competitions for policy holders and their brokers who opt for customer eDocs. Watch out for details.
