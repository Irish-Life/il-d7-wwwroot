Certification as a Qualified Financial Advisor means that I hold a professional diploma in Financial Advice and that I participate in a continuous development programme to ensure that I keep abreast of all the latest developments in personal financial services.</p><p>I have been working for Irish Life since 2006. I went to college in the Dublin Institute of Technology where I studied Marketing & French for 4 years - I have a degree in Marketing (Bsc(Mgmt)) and I also completed the Marketing Institute of Ireland exams straight after college.</p><p>Post college, I worked as an IT/Telecoms Recruitment Consultant for about 3-4 years before deciding it was time to go \"down under\" and travel & work for one & half years. I lived and worked in Melbourne and Sydney and managed to squeeze in travelling through Asia, around Australia and also New Zealand.</p><p>I came back in 2006 and have been here in Irish Life ever since. I'm a massive fan of various sports, mainly Athletics, Basketball & GAA. I've recently taken up triathlons for my sins and recently completed the TriAthy to which I was delighted to have even finished the three events back-to-back in one piece and still manage to be able to walk the next day! </p>",

Certification as a Qualified Financial Advisor means that I hold a professional Diploma in Financial Advice and that I participate in a continuous development programme to ensure that I keep abreast of all the latest developments in personal financial services. As outlined in my video clip, I am in the process of completing a Pensions Diploma which I expect to have completed in full by February 2011.</p><p>Since joining Irish Life, I have being providing quality advice to my customers and providing tailored recommendations on regular savings, investments and on how to replace income in the event of death, serious illness or retirement.  I work closely with business owners and company directors in looking at ways to turn company profits into personal wealth. Those who are self employed tend to meet me to look at options in relation to offsetting their tax bill while ensuring they have additional benefits in place. I aim to provide a more holistic approach to Financial Planning to ensure that my clients' financial goals and objectives are being met throughout our relationship.</p><p>I have particular expertise in the area of pensions including PRSA's and payroll deduction services. I believe the key to providing high quality advice to both employers and employees is to have a regular on-site presence that lets customers discuss their ever-changing retirement needs. These regular visits also allow me to keep my customers up to date on legislative changes that may have an impact on their retirement planning.

I attended the Institute of Technology Tallaght, where I studied Business Management and French for 4 years. I now hold an Honours degree in Business Management Bbs(Mgmt).</p><p>Post college, I completed a graduate programme with Enterprise rent-a-car which gave me a great base and understanding of all aspects of client relationship management and key account services.</p><p>I'm currently in the process of completing my Pensions Diploma which I will have by mid 2011. This is a specialised qualification, which is designed to develop and understand the principles in relation to retirement in general. With such a wide range of pension products on the Irish Market a thorough understanding of underlying principles is essential when advising a client on a retirement strategy.</p><p>I'm a massive fan of various sports, and keeping fit by going to the gym every morning before work. I like to play soccer and golf in my spare time. During my schoolboy days, while playing for Belvedere FC and attending De La Salle, I represented my school for both Leinster and Ireland. I would like in the next couple of years to complete my FAI & UEFA coaching badges and potentially coach, back at schoolboy level.</p><p>I specialise in providing financial solutions to families around personal finance, Company directors, The professionally self-employed and delivering financial wellbeing seminars to employees in the SME sector.</p><p>Primarily, I advise on how to protect your most important asset, your family. I focus on this in the event of you living too long (Retirement Provisions), dying too soon (Business and family protection) or getting sick in between (Protecting your income and Serious Illness Cover).</p><p>My key goal when meeting a potential client is building relationships as circumstances can change dramatically as each year goes by!!!</p><p>I look forward in anticipation to meeting you in the near future.</p>",

Certification as a Qualified Financial Advisor means that I hold a professional diploma in Financial Advice and that I participate in a continuous development programme to ensure that I keep abreast of all the latest developments in personal financial services.</p><p>I have been working for Irish Life since 1999. I hold a degree in Economics and Politics from UCD. After college I lived in Madrid for seven years and became fluent in Spanish. On returning home to Ireland I joined Irish Life after completing a post-graduate diploma in Financial Services.  Since then, I have accumulated over ten years experience in providing quality advice to my customers, providing tailored recommendations on regular savings, investments and on how to replace income in the event of death, serious illness or retirement.</p><p>I have particular expertise in the area of pensions including PRSAs and payroll deduction services. I believe the key to providing high quality advice to both employers and employees alike is to have a regular on-site presence that lets customers discuss their ever-changing retirement needs. These regular visits also allow me to keep my customers up to date on legislative changes that may have an impact on their retirement planning. If you are an employer or employee in the South Dublin area and would like to find out more about the hassle-free services I provide, just click on the link to request a call back.</p>",

Certification as a Qualified Financial Advisor means that I hold a professional Diploma in Financial Advice and that I participate in a continuous development program to ensure that I keep abreast of all the latest developments in personal financial services.</p><p>Since 1981 I have been providing financial advice to people in the Clondalkin/Palmerstown/Ballyfermot and Chapelizod areas, and since 1997 I have also serviced the Swords/ Coolock/Kilbarrack and Donaghmede areas. I currently advise in excess of 700 clients. These are primarily families, self-employed individuals, young people starting out and older people in retirement.</p><p>People sometimes feel that financial planning can be confusing and complicated. What I bring to my role and to the clients that I meet is a desire to ensure that their financial goals and concerns are central to our meeting and are dealt with in a clear and jargon free way. I help people make real decisions that protect both themselves and their family.</p><p>During my 30 years as a Financial Consultant I have witnessed the economic boom and bust cycle a number of times in the past. Every individual situation is different; my task is to provide financial solutions to meet each individual's specific need. In the past year alone I have met with and helped many individuals, families and businesses to develop and adapt their financial plans for these difficult economic times. The biggest endorsement of what I bring to my role in Irish Life is that a high percentage of the people I meet are referred to me by my clients who feel that their family and friends would benefit from meeting with me</p>",
