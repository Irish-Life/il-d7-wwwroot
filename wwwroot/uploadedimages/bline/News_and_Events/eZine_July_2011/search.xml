Central to this campaign is a hard hitting TV advert which, together with a national and local newspaper and radio campaign, should help drive awareness and
Feedback from recent surveys: The Market is definitely out there
We recently conducted an extensive piece of customer research with the Amárach Group on peoples’ attitudes to life cover and protection products. The results were shocking and stimulating but above all extremely exciting from a business opportunity point of view. Click on the video below which will bring you to our TV Advert. We have complimented the television advertising with an extensive suite of marketing materials – flyers, DM letters, PowerPoint slide shows to run in your reception area and posters to dress your shop front window. Log on to www.bline.ie and click on the Big Ideas Day section to see if there is something there that you feel could work for you.
 Almost 1 in 2 Irish adults have NO protection cover at all – that’s 1.6million
people!
 2 out of 3 people who have cover only have enough to cover their mortgage  75,000 babies will be born in Ireland in 2011. This means a massively
increasing market for family based protection.
1 in 5 people are considering buying a life cover product in the next 12 months. What a wonderful opportunity - approximately 320,000 families waiting to be approached and already considering becoming your client!]]></paragraph>

Irish Life was the first to bring the concept of partial payments on Specified Illness plans to the Irish market. We felt this was the right way to go forward – to pay more claims and satisfy more customers. We are now covering more illnesses on full payment and partial payment. In addition, your customers can now avail of multiple partial payments should they occur and we have significantly increased our Angioplasty offering. Click here for a Sales Idea on estate planning Estate Planning – Is there still a market for Inheritance Tax planning? Well the Revenue returns would suggest there is. Last year over €186 million was paid to the Revenue in respect of IHT. That’s at least €750 million of assets still falling into this net.
Improved product flexibility
As part of the product update we have also included product flexibility into our plans. This allows customers to make significant changes to their level or term of benefits without cancelling and taking out a new plan. Click here for more details on product news. We’ve also included a useful comparison flyer, click here to compare the various market offerings at a glance.
Click here for a Sales Idea for non-married couples
Non married couples – 1 in 10 people are co-habiting in Ireland. Are any of your clients in this group? Most people are aware that benefits passing between married couples are exempt from Inheritance & Gift Tax. However this only applies in the case of “Legal Spouses” and registered Civil Partners. All other couples are treated as strangers for capital acquisitions tax purposes.]]></paragraph>

Of this, some may be used to pay off debts, but a large proportion is being used to increase savings. We have 2 simple solutions that we believe will help you to encourage these savers away from deposits and into more long term solutions:
Our new savings contract, Pinnacle, is designed to provide strong underlying value for the client and for the first time in this market remunerating brokers for the continuous long term advice which they provide to their clients.
For clients who have large sums of money on deposit and are worried about trying to time the markets then we have the perfect solution for you and your clients in Auto-Start. Three simple steps: 1. 2. 3. Build a portfolio that matches your clients risk Simply tick the Auto-Start box on the application form We will drip feed in 10% of the portfolio over 10 months from the safe deposit fund - currently offering ECB + 2%
Added Flexibility: You can turn Auto-Start off at any stage. Click below for our recent savings article which appeared in the Irish Broker Magazine Savings – a booming market with more yet to come Click here for a two page flyer explaining the AutoStart process in detail]]></paragraph>

It was the event of the year and not to be missed as brokers, staff, colleagues, family and friends travelled from every county to ensure they were there to celebrate what was truly a most memorable evening. Kevin Murphy took the audience through Willie’s career from his very first day in 1973 as the long haired Actuarial student through to the present and his pride in winning the IBA award as General Manager, Brokerage. Tom Fitzgerald made a very gracious toast on behalf of the broker community, paying tribute to Willie’s many virtues. Words such as passion, honesty, commitment, energy, and integrity were mentioned again and again during the evening, values that he never preached but lived! Willie paid special tribute to his family for their support over the years, especially for all the birthdays, football matches and special occasions missed because of work commitments including LIMRA, Sales Institute, Actuarial Society, LIA etc. It was a huge matter of pride that his mother was there to enjoy the evening with him. What do you present a man who has everything to mark such a distinguished career? Tony Lawless managed to deliver the holy grail, the one item every Kildare man dreams of receiving in Croke Park, The Sam Maguire Cup. While Willie held Sam over his head, he put the challenge down to Dermot Early who was in the audience - that he expected Dermot to bring Sam home to Celbridge in September – it appears even in retirement Willie is still issuing orders and setting objectives!!! While we all wish Willie the very best in retirement, he has the Life Assurance Industry in his blood, and we would not be surprised to see his invaluable contribution for many more years to come!!!
Kevin Murphy, Chief Executive, makes a presentation to Willie after taking the audience rather humorously, through Willie’s Irish Life career from day one in 1973 right up to date when Irish Life took top Life Company award at the recent IBA Awards under Willie’s guidance as General Manager, Brokerage
Tony Lawless, Willie’s successor as General Manager, Brokerage managed to ‘borrow’ Sam Maguire from Cork and presented it to Willie who said that he hoped to be the 2nd Kildare man this year to lift Sam in Croke Park
Willie and his wife Breda, staunch Kildare supporters threw down the gauntlet to Kildare footballers Dermot Earley, left and Brian Flanagan right about the ‘Lillywhites’ delivering the Holy Grail to Celbridge in September!
Tom Fitzgerald made a gracious toast , on behalf of the ‘Broker Community.’ Needless to say, Willie needed a seat for this one.]]></paragraph>

		<paragraph number="1"><![CDATA[In August we will implement 2 major innovations to improve service for you and your customers.
eTexts for customers
All new customers for whom we have mobile phone numbers will have the opportunity to receive new business progress updates via text message. These updates will inform them as their application completes key stages in the New Business process:     Application received Application successfully underwritten Application needs further medical info Policy documents issued
We are also going to offer policy value texts. These will be driven by an upper and lower trigger values nominated by the customer. If the policy value breaches either value the customer is informed by text. All e-Text messages will advise the customer to contact their broker for further information. We piloted this service and customer feedback has been uniformly positive so far. The eTexting service will be voluntary – individual customers can opt out or a broker can opt on their clients behalf. As always, Irish Life puts you in control.
eDOCs for customers
Following on the success of eDocs for Brokers, from September, policy holders also will have the option of paperless policy servicing with Irish Life. In a similar fashion to eDocs for Brokers, customers will be able to opt to view all their routine correspondence on the web. Customers will receive an email and text message notification of each document produced. We are planning to run monthly incentive competitions for policy holders and their brokers who opt for customer eDocs. Watch out for details.]]></paragraph>
